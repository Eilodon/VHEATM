# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-1 — Bound activation and typed execution kernel

**Status:** ✅ ACCEPTED
**Date:** 2026-08-01
**Deciders:** VHEATM maintainers
**Tags:** `authority-kernel` `typed-execution` `provenance`
**Change Classification:** `DESIGN CHANGE`
**Review date:** 2026-09-01 — re-evaluate when a second runtime entry point consumes context v2 or 1,000 plan revisions have been replayed.
**Supersedes:** —
**Superseded by:** —

**DECISION TYPE:** `CONSTRAINT-FORCED`
**CONFIDENCE:** `HIGH` — direct mutation and regression tests cover the trust-boundary invariants.
**LAST CONFIRMED:** 2026-08-01 — `IMPLEMENTATION`
**VOLATILITY:** `WATCHFUL` — the authority model will be revisited when the session/CAS layer lands.

### Context

The V17 plan cache could be altered by a caller after evaluation, raw artifact parsing could clear taint, and reports could claim passing gates without a bound module invocation or typed output. The original context contract also accepted an empty object and could not represent late findings that change activation obligations.

### Decision

Make activation plans content-bound to the canonical manifest, normalized context, evaluator build, and revision metadata; recompute them at router, aggregator, and report trust boundaries. Keep raw sources tainted until an explicit validation receipt exists. Route modules through typed output contracts, bind `ModuleRun` records to module/instruction digests, and derive gate results only from validated runs and decision artifacts. Add a schema-v2 context adapter plus immutable, parent-bound plan revisions for late facts while retaining v1 compatibility aliases.

### Options Considered

- Trust caller-provided activation states and report gate results: rejected because it creates false assurance at the authority boundary.
- Copy all legacy prose into runtime modules: rejected because it exceeds the disclosure budget and still does not prove execution.
- Require a full SQLite/CAS/session implementation before these controls: rejected for this slice; it would delay containment of the already observed P0 failures.

### Impact

Schemas changed: `audit-context`, `gate-plan`, `module-contract`, `module-selection`, `audit-report`, provenance, artifact, module-run, failure, tool, and validation-receipt schemas.
Components changed: evaluator, router, execution aggregator, report validator, provenance registry, structural probe, and module contracts.
Breaking change: **YES** for unbound external plans and reports without typed execution; v1 contexts remain supported through the adapter.

IMPACT RADIUS: **MODERATE**
Cascades: `context → plan → selection → ModuleRun/artifacts → gate results → report`.
Cascade Review: ✅ Done

### Consequences

- Plan tampering, missing invocation, forged output payloads, tainted evidence, and unbound selection are fail-closed.
- Module contracts now expose reusable typed output schemas without creating one schema per module.
- Context v2 can derive mandatory findings from its ledger and create a child plan for late facts.
- SQLite/CAS persistence, subject tree/session roots, sandbox enforcement, independent judge isolation, and analyzer/provider integration remain deferred; this slice does not claim production attestation for those capabilities.

### Evidence

- [verified 2026-08-01] `.venv/bin/vheatm-validate --root .` passed.
- [verified 2026-08-01] `.venv/bin/pytest -q` passed with the full repository suite.
- [verified 2026-08-01] v2 low-risk evaluation and context/plan routing both returned exit 0 with 15 active, 7 inactive, 0 unknown, and 3374/4096 estimated tokens.
- [verified 2026-08-01] Mutation tests reject activation-state edits, unbound plans, missing validation receipts, forged artifacts, missing module runs, and direct aggregator plan spoofing.

### Known Debts (PATTERN-DEBT)

PATTERN-DEBT entries introduced or affected by this change: none registered. Deferred architectural work is listed under Consequences and is tracked by the V17 roadmap, not silently treated as complete.

### Next Cycle Trigger

Start the next cycle when the first SQLite/CAS-backed session store is introduced or when any second runtime entry point consumes a plan revision; both events require replay, crash/recovery, and subject-root binding tests.

### Cycle Retrospective

- The main false-assurance risk was at trust boundaries, not in the activation parser itself; recomputation must happen at every consumer.
- Updating module contracts required regenerating every registry digest; registry integrity is part of runtime correctness.
- A validation receipt must be modeled separately from source and claim records; changing taint state alone is not evidence.
- The v1 adapter must preserve unknown rather than infer missing critical declarations.
- The next cycle should avoid presenting the context-v2 adapter as a complete session model until subject snapshots and CAS roots are implemented.
